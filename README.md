## ðŸ’» My Projects

Here are some highlights of projects Iâ€™ve worked on:

### - Using Machine Learning to Transcribe Arabic Sign Language  
A research project where we built software that translates hand gestures into Arabic text using computer vision and machine learning â€” aimed at making communication easier for people with hearing impairments.

### - ICAISC 2023 Drone Challenge  
With zero prior experience, my team and I learned to assemble and pilot drones in just a few days, ultimately winning 3rd place! This taught me how fast I can adapt and innovate under pressure.
